The softiwarp kernel module can be build now without access
to the kernel source tree. This directory contains all files
needed to build a SoftiWARP kernel module 'siw.ko' which was
tested to fit with a running 2.6.34 kernel:

use <make> to build a siw.ko kernel module in the current directory

use <make install> to install the kernel module as
	/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/extra/siw.ko 

use <make clean> to cleanup things

use <insmod /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/extra/siw.ko> to insert
the softiwarp kernel module. Please load rdma_cm, ib_uverbs, and rdma_ucm
kernel modules before.

compile time flags:
	-DCHECK_DMA_CAPABILITIES
		Checks if the device siw wants to attach to provides
		DMA capabilities. While DMA capabilities are currently not
		needed (siw works on top of a kernel tcp socket), siw
		uses ib_umem_get() which performs a (not used) DMA address
		translation. Writing a siw private memory reservation and
		pinning routine would solve the issue.

module parameters:
	loopback_enabled: if set, attaches siw also to the looback device.
		To be set only during module insertion.

	mpa_crc_enabled:  if set, the MPA CRC gets generated and checked 
		both in tx and rx path (kills all throughput).
		To be set only during module insertion.

	zcopy_tx:	  if set, payload of non signalled work requests
		(such as non signalled WRITE or SEND as well as all READ
		 responses) are transferred using the TCP sockets
		sendpage interface. This parameter can be switched on and
		off dynamically (echo 1 >> /sys/module/siw/parameters/zcopy_tx
		for enablement, 0 for disabling). System load benefits from
		using 0copy data transmission: a servers load of
		one 2.5 GHz CPU may drop from 55 percent down to 23 percent
		if serving 100KByte READ responses at 10GbE's line speed.
